Installing Java and WEKA

To install Java and Weka, please do the following:
Install the JRE (Java Runtime Environment). You can download it from java.com. (This requires reboot in windows.)
Install WEKA. You can download it from the Weka home page. This home page also has a single download that includes JRE too.
To run WEKA, you should open a command prompt window (on Windows) or a terminal window (on mac or unix) and go to the "weka-3-4" folder. Then issue the command

     java -jar weka.jar
Sometimes, WEKA may run out of memory. If this happens, you can rerun it and tell java to allocate more memory. I use the following command:
     java -Xmx200m -jar weka.jar
